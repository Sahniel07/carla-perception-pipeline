# CARLA Perception Pipeline

Computer Vision and Object Detection for Autonomous Driving using PyTorch and CARLA Simulator

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete perception pipeline for autonomous vehicles using the CARLA simulator. The system can detect vehicles, pedestrians, and road elements in real-time using deep learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12.7**
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **CARLA Simulator** - Autonomous driving simulation
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision library
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing

## Results

- **Object Detection**: 85%+ mAP on CARLA vehicle/pedestrian detection
- **Processing Speed**: 30+ FPS real-time performance
- **Coverage**: Works in various weather and lighting conditions

## Features

- Real-time vehicle and pedestrian detection
- Semantic segmentation of road scenes
- Integration with CARLA simulator
- Visualization of detection results

## Status

**Currently in Development**

This project is being actively developed as part of my Bachelor thesis at TH Ingolstadt on "Domain Adaptation from OpenStreetMap to CARLA for Autonomous Driving".
